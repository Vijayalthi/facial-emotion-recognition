# Facial Emotion Recognition System

This project is a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system built using deep learning. It uses a pre-trained **VGG16** model for feature extraction and an **LSTM** network for learning temporal patterns in facial expressions. The system is trained on the **FER2013 dataset** to classify emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, and more.
